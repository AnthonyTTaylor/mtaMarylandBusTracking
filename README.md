Some civic hacking on the MTA's Real-time Bus Data

##Project Goals:

- Archival and sharing of Real-time data
- Reporting on the quality, consistency, and availabiity of real-time data from the MTA
- Reporting on "timeliness" of individual bus routes by comparing real-time data to schedules
- Building a more developer-friendly proxy API so that third parties can add value for consumers
